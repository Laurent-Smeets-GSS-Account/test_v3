# Listening to Indonesia

The Listening to Indonesia is the World Bank analytical program to track household welfare, economic conditions, and public sentiment through regular panel surveys across the country. In the first stage, we visit 500 communities across the country, oversampling from households with small enterprises. Next, we randomly select four households from each community to participate in the monthly panel. We interview the same households every month, replacing if needed from the same community if a household drops.

## What is Listening to Indonesia?

- Nationally representative survey on social and economic wellbeing every month
- Measuring impact of policy or reforms, with a very short lag
- Blends welfare monitoring with polling questions, focused on the drivers of change
- Interviews with people from all walks of life, regions, rural and urban areas
